# Creating Art Using Financial Engineering

Co-created with Parth7.  

We use financial engineering techniques to create art using Python (matlibplot).  

We try to use various techniques in order to price different assets instead of using the same method each time! Such methods include: Monte Carlo, Fourier Transform, Finite Difference Methods and Analytical Methods (if applicable).
